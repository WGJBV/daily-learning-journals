# Learning Journal Day 3 William Johnson
I've learned a lot today! I now know how to do for loops, nested if statements, nested while loops and a whole bunch else. I also got a lot more CSS knowledge under my belt but I am still lagging a little bit on my website. I'm having a great time working in these shells and I also learned that there are a couple of more CSS and HTML resources like w3schools, repl.it, codepen and treehouse for CSS. I'll check out more CSS tutorials tonight. I also learned I should really utilize psuedocode.
