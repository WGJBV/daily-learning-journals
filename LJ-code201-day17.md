#Learning Journal day 17
Today was our second day programming our Cat Fight page and it was a majority JS day. Lots and lots of JS. Which was really good because I learned about a lot more about Forms and CSS targeting. I had a great time pair programming with Kat on a lot of the issues with the Form and passing into localStorage.
