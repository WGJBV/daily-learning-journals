#Learning Journal day 3
Today I learned A WHOLE LOT about jQuery and how it specifically targets objects and attributes. Incredibly helpful solutions to a lot of issues that I had run into in 201. It is so wonderful to be able to use jQuery. My partners were fantastic today and were great teachers.
