#Learning Journal day 16
Today I learned a lot about how the target and how event listeners work. I'm confident in my abilities using event handlers and listeners and I know now how to utilize libraries. Kat helped us a lot with the CSS of the site and I'm very thankful because CSS is one of my weaker suits.
