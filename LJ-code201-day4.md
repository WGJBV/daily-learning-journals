# Learning Journal 4 William Johnson
Today I learned a lot more about arrays than I bargained for. MY partner for Pair programming (Dustin) was very knowledgable on nested arrays. It was crazy what we got my code to and admittedly I was very lost at points. However now, at the end of the project, I finally understand. I've learned a TON about arrays and for loop functionalities. And in lecture I learned a lot about CSS layout and more about CSS resources that I can use in the future.
