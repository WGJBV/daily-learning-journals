# LJ Day 2 William Johnson

Today I learned a lot about different commands in the terminal and how powerful it is. I had to go back and reinstall linter but I was able to do it by myself by using the different terminals commands I had learned yesterday and refined today. I had a great time re-learning all the html commands and tags. CSS was good to see again after a couple of weeks of not seeing too much of it. I feel pretty happy with the end product that I came out with and hopefully it won't need too much touching up in the future. :)s
